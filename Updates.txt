    * Added calculations of amplification ratio

20160122
    * Updated the submitScript.sh script to make it possible to use option 1 and 2 (wait until previous steps are done
    before continuing) to allow for merging of files from all samples in a run
    * Updating the extraction of EGFR information and merging into one file
    * Adding extraction of known SNPs in the colon panel
    * Adding extraction of filtered variants in exon 18-21 in EGFR outside of hotspots to hotspotlist
    * Adding thresholds for extraction of ACVR2A MSI markers
20151204
    * Changed aligner from Mosaik to Bwa
    * Updated cutadapt to a new version which cuts both reads at the same time and removes empty read pairs
    * A general look through and updating of necessary script and programs
20151015
    * Changing the vaf calculation for insertions from Pindel. The reference alleles reported from pindel is the real reference allele depth
    giving the total read depth being ref_RD + var_RD
    * Extracting MSI markers from FilteredAnnovarOutput
    * Removing blacklistpositions in automatic filtering step.
    * Making it possible to keep specific regions even if they are intronic in filtering of Annovar
20150904
    * Updated to new annovar and new annovar modules. Therefore createAnnovarOutput.pl had to be updated to match the new outputformat.
    * Added one line per sample with information about tissue type
    * Added a step for automatic filtering of annovar and pindel annovar output
20150827
    * Corrected the insertion allele frequency calculation from Pindel and re-run all runs from August
20150422
	* The merging of Pindel results now only consider indels in the given exons of the given genes
	* Indexfile can be separated on ,
20150227
	* Changing in ExtractClinicalPostions.sh. Each sample has to have the hotspot file listed to make it possible to run
	a mix of different sample types in one run 
	* Adding HOTSPOTFILE_ARR and INDELFILE_ARR to submitScripts.sh
	* Updating createInputFile.py to also take care of different hotspot and indel lists for different samples of different cancer types
	* In ClinicalPositions.pl, changed the way of calculating variant alleleratio for multiple base pair variamts in hotspotlist
	taking the lowest variant allele ratio for the bases included and added sample id in the first column
	* Adding a quality control step by running FastQC on the cutadapted sequences
	* Added a step to merge pindel output for specific genes with the clinical positions to get one output file 
	* Added module_locator.py to make it possible to determine the path to the pythonscript folder
	
20150112
	* Changing method for giving normal/annovar sample info

20141204
    * Adding mergeregions.py, intersection.py and extractEnds.py to remove the need of sedd
    in the analysis pipeline
    * Added calculateGeneCov_bed.py which can be used to calculate the gene or region coverage
    * Added SERA_PBS_SUBMIT_clinic.sh which has a shorter list of options and the steps normally
    used are set to on automatically
    * Added ROOT_PATH_PINDEL to globals file instead of having it in the RunPindel.sh
    * Added path to annovar modules to globals file instead of having it in RunAnnovar.sh
    * Changed globalsUppnex.sh and globalsSmaug.sh to globalsHome.sh and globalsProj.sh to make it 
    possible to easy switch between using the common project files for clinical sequencing facility and
    using home directory
    * Added module load python/2.7 to modules.sh
    * Added option to copy reference files to refFiles in analysis folder when creating the input file

20141120
	* Changing total read depth calculation in ClinicalPositions.pl from the sum of the 
	reference read depth and the variant read depth to the sum of the reference read depth
	and the read depths of all variants present.
	* Adding functionality to run Pindel and annotate the pindel output including adding
	Pindel parameters to input file.
	* Added createInputFile.py in SERA/bin/pythonscript directory
